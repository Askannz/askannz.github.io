title = "About me"
+++

My name is Robin Lange, I go online by Gazoche or Askannz.

I was born in France but lived most of my life overseas, first in [New Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia) then 7 years Singapore and Australia. I now live on the southern French Mediterranean coast, where I work as a Data Engineer for the Amadeus IT Group (as a full-time subcontractor).

My previous work was at the Singapore-based startup [See-Mode Technologies](https://www.see-mode.com/), specialized in AI analysis of medical images. I was present at the company's inception (as the first employee) and worked there for almost 7 years helping to build it from the ground up. See-Mode has recently [been acquired](https://www.radnet.com/about-radnet/news/radnet-inc-acquires-see-mode-technologies-for-innovation-in-ai-powered-ultrasound-diagnostics) by the large US Radiology chain RadNet. 

### Skills

Although my recent professional experience has been pretty focused on data engineering and machine learning, I have experience in other areas. 

What I can do:
* Python backend programming
* Cloud architecture (mostly AWS) and Docker
* Linux sysadmin things
* Spark and Databricks
* PostgreSQL, MongoDB
* Some data scientist skills (Jupyter, Pandas, Plotly and the like)

I also have an interest in low-level systems programming and OS development (checkout my [projects page](/projects)). I'm pretty flexible with my skills generally, and can get up to speed rapidly on new technologies.

**Programming languages:** a lot of Python, but I have some experience in C and Scala and write Rust projects in my spare time.

**Human languages:** french (native tongue), english (fluent)
