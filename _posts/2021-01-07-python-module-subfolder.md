# The problem

Suppose that you have a script `script.py` that imports something from another file `dependency.py`. The two files are at the same level in the project hierarchy.

```
my_project/
├── script.py
└── dependency.py
```

To import whatever you need from `dependency.py`, you can just use an absolute import statement, like so:

```
from dependency import my_function
```

So far so good. But now let's imagine the project has grown a bit and you need to put `script.py` into a subfolder, whereas `dependency.py` needs to stay at the top-level because other files depend on it.

```
my_project/
├── subfolder
│   └── script.py
└── dependency.py
```

If you try to run the script from the root folder, you'll be greeted with this:

```
$ python subfolder/script.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/robin/tmp/python_module_demo/my_project/subfolder/script.py", line 1, in <module>
    from dependency import my_function
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dependency
```

Ok, Python cannot find the `dependency` module anymore. Maybe we need to tell it to fetch it one folder higher ? Let's try changing `from dependency import my_function` to `from ..dependency import my_function`.

```
$ python subfolder/script.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/robin/tmp/python_module_demo/my_project/subfolder/script.py", line 1, in <module>
    from ..dependency import my_function
ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
```

Still doesn't work, but the error is different. You can try running `script.py` from `subfolder/` instead, but you'll get similar errors.


# The solution

Every Python programmer has been confronted to that issue. Curiously, Googling "python import from parent folder" will almost always point you toward weird hacks that involve modifying `sys.path`, setting a `PYTHONPATH` variable, or even using pip to link the current directory as a development package. There is a much more idiomatic and (in my opinion) much more practical solution.

Simply put all your code in a subfolder (which we'll call `my_module` because that's actually what it is), like so:

```
my_project/
└ my_module
  ├── subfolder
  │   └── script.py
  └── dependency.py
```

For the import statement, use `from ..dependency import my_function`. The `..` means "one level higher from `subfolder`, which correspond to `my_module`.

So how are you supposed to run `script.py` now ? **The trick is to tell Python not to run it as a script, but as a Python module.** You can do this using the `-m` parameter, like so:

```
python -m my_module.subfolder.script
```

Now, because all the code is encapsulated inside a single module, Python will have no issue fetching `my_function` from one file up. Note that the working directory is still the one where you invoke the command from, so `my_project/` in this case.

This solution also solves the problem of imports from sibling folders. Let's say for example that you have the following project structure:

```
my_project/
├── subfolder_A
│   └── script_A.py
└── subfolder_B
    └── dependency_B.py
```

Where `script_A.py` wants to import `my_function` from `dependency_B.py`. Just put everything in a Python module like before:

```
my_project/
└ my_module
  ├── subfolder_A
  │   └── script_A.py
  └── subfolder_B
      └── dependency_B.py
```

Now `script_A.py` can import the function like this: `from ..subfolder_B.dependency_B import my_function`, and you can run it with

```
python -m my_module.subfolder_A.script_A
```

# Additional tricks

## The __main__ guard

In both the examples above, our target script is also itself a module, and therefore it's possible to import stuff from it. However, when a module is imported, everything in its global scope is executed, which can have unintended consequences. In other words, if your `script.py` looks like this:

```python
def my_other_function():
    print("Hello from my_other_function")
    
print("Hello")
```

Then importing `from script import my_other_function` in another file will also execute the `print("Hello")` statement.
This is why Python scripts traditionally wrap their code in a `if __name__ == "__main__":` statement:

```python
def my_other_function():
    print("Hello from my_other_function")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello")
```

This way, `print("Hello")` will only execute if the module is ran directly with `python -m`, and not if `script` is imported by some other module.


## Run a whole folder as a script

This is a small but neat feature. In the first example above, if you rename `script.py` as `__main__.py`, you will be able to call `subfolder` directly as if it was an executable script itself: `python -m my_module.subfolder`. It can be pretty useful to get rid of superflous submodules and shorten the invocation path.
